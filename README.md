# Word-Embedding-Using-Keras--NLP-Deep-Learning
Word embeddings provide a dense representation of words and their relative meanings.They are an improvement over sparse representations used in simpler bag of word model representations.Word embeddings can be learned from text data and reused among projects. They can also be learned as part of fitting a neural network on text data.
